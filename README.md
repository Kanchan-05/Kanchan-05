### Hi ðŸ‘‹ I am Kanchan!

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Center for Gravitational Wave Astronomy and Astrophysics at Syracuse University](https://gravitationalwaves.syracuse.edu/people/). 

I work on gravitational wave search from compact binary mergers.
More information about my research can be found on my [website](https://kanchansoni.owlstown.net). 

In my Ph.D I worked on developing a hierarchical search method using PyCBC-framework. This search pipeline could be find in [Github](https://github.com/Kanchan-05/pycbc/tree/hierarchical_subsolar) under the hierarchical_subsolar branch.
