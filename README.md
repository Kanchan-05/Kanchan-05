### Hi 👋 I am Kanchan!

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Center for Gravitational Wave Astronomy and Astrophysics at Syracuse University](https://gravitationalwaves.syracuse.edu/people/). 

My research focuses on developing efficient and scalable search algorithms to detect gravitational waves from compact binary mergers. I am particularly interested in techniques that improve sensitivity and reduce latency, making them suitable for next-generation observatories.

In my Ph.D, I worked on developing a hierarchical search method using the PyCBC framework. This search pipeline could be found in [Github](https://github.com/Kanchan-05/pycbc/tree/hierarchical_subsolar) under the hierarchical_subsolar branch.
